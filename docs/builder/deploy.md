# Hathora Builder - Reference: Deploy

After your application is working as desired locally, you may want to deploy it on the internet. Hathora Cloud can host your backend, and you may choose any CDN of choice to serve your assets.

### Build Artifacts

First, you must build your server and client by running `hathora build`. This will create `dist` directories inside `server` and also inside each `client` subdirectories.

The directory structure will look something like this:

```
. # project root
├─ client
│  ├─ prototype-ui
│  │  ├─ package.json
│  │  └─ dist
│  └─ web
│     ├─ package.json
│     └─ dist
└─ server
   └─ dist
```

### Client

The `client/<app>` directory is a self contained frontend application and can be deployed to any CDN like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](vercel.com), or [Surge](https://surge.sh/).

For example, you can deploy your application's Prototype UI to Surge by running the following command from your project root:

```sh
surge client/prototype-ui/dist my-app.surge.sh
```

### Server

The `server/dist` directory is a self contained backend application that can be deployed to any cloud server or application hosting environment.

For Typescript backends, the only file inside the `server/dist` directory is `index.mjs`. The two requirements for running the backend are:

- Node.js must be installed
- The `DATA_DIR` environment variable must be set to the path where Hathora should write its data files

### Hathora Cloud

Navigate to the project root for your game and confirm there is a Dockerfile (this file is automatically generated when you run `hathora init`)

```
. # project root
├─ client
│  ├─ prototype-ui
│  └─ web
└─ Dockerfile
└─ server
```

1. Create a tar of your server project. 
2. Upload your server build to Hathora Cloud from either the [Console UI](https://console.hathora.dev/login) or using the CLI command below with your `AppId`.
```
hathora-cloud builds create --appId {"HATHORA_APP_ID"}
```
