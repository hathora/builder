# Hathora Builder - Reference: Server

The server has three responsibilities:

1. Creating the initial internal state
2. Mutating the internal state via methods and/or `onTick`
3. Deriving the appropriate `userState` per user from the internal state

## Internal State

For each stateId, the backend maintains an internal representation of the state in memory inside the server. The internal state type is passed into the `Methods` interface as a parameter so that it can enforce the correct class structure. Your `impl.ts` must export a class conforming to this `Methods` interface.

Note that in simple cases, the `userState` can be used as the type of internal state (see [chat example](https://github.com/hathora/hathora/tree/develop/examples/chat)). However, many times you may want a separate representation of internal state which then gets converted to the `userState` via the `getUserState()` function. By having this separation between server state and user state, you can do things like:

- enforce privacy by selectively allowing access to parts of the state per user (e.g. private messages in [chat example](https://github.com/hathora/hathora/blob/develop/examples/chat/server/impl.ts))
- allow for a more optimized data structure in the server (e.g. chess.js in [chess example](https://github.com/hathora/hathora/blob/develop/examples/chess/server/impl.ts))
- derive certain properties rather than store them (e.g. game status in [codenames example](https://github.com/hathora/hathora/blob/develop/examples/codenames/server/impl.ts))

The internal state can be composed of any primitives and built in data structures of the language, including objects, classes, and functions.

The internal state is first created via the `initialize` method:

Example (poker game):

```ts
// impl.ts

// ...

export class Impl implements Methods<InternalState> {
  initialize(ctx: Context, request: IInitializeRequest): InternalState {
    return {
      players: [],
      dealerIdx: 0,
      activePlayerIdx: 0,
      revealedCards: [],
      smallBlindAmt: 0,
      deck: [],
    };
  }
  // ...
}
```

## Mutation

The server mutates state via the functions defined in the `methods` section of `hathora.yml` or via the special `onTick` function.

Methods receive four arguments as input:

1. `state`: the internal state describe above
2. `userId`: the id of the user who called the method
3. `ctx`: a context object, which must be used for sources of nondeterminism (random values, current time, api calls)
4. `request`: the input arguments to the method as defined in `hathora.yml`

Based on these inputs, the method can validate whether the action is permitted, returning an error response if not. Otherwise, the method can mutate `state` as desired and return a success response. Any mutations that occur will ultimately be reflected in the client state via the `getUserState` function.

### Context API

```ts
ctx.chance // a ChanceJs object for random-based operations

ctx.time // the current time (ms since epoch)

ctx.sendEvent(event: string, to: UserId) // send an event to a particular user

ctx.broadcastEvent(event: string) // broadcast an event to all connected users
```

## getUserState

The `getUserState` function converts the internal state to the user state based on the userId.

Example (poker game):

```ts
  getUserState(state: InternalState, userId: UserId): PlayerState {
    return {
      players: state.players.map((player) => {
        const shouldReveal = player.id === userId || (showdown && player.status === PlayerStatus.PLAYED);
        return {
          ...player,
          cards: shouldReveal ? player.cards.map((card) => ({ rank: card[0], suit: card[1] })) : [],
        };
      }),
      dealer: state.players[state.dealerIdx].id,
      activePlayer: state.players[state.activePlayerIdx].id,
      revealedCards: state.revealedCards.map((card) => ({ rank: card[0], suit: card[1] })),
    };
  }
```

## onTick

Sometimes apps may want some way to execute logic in the backend at a fixed interval outside of user called methods. Common use cases for this include running simulations (e.g. physics simulations in games), sending notifications, or updating clocks/timers.

To enable this functionality, simply set the `tick` key in `hathora.yml` to an integer (>= 50) representing the interval at which the server will call the `onTick` function. This will add an `onTick` function to the `Methods` interface. The `onTick` function takes the internal state, context object, and time delta (representing the seconds elapsed since the previous `onTick` invocation) as arguments. Any mutations that occur inside this function will be handled the same way as mutations inside the methods.
