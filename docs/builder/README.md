## Motivation

Building a multiplayer game can be extremely challenging. On top of the challenges of building a single player game, you now have to constantly battle the network and latency, find ways to prevent cheating, and figure out how to make a scalable backend architecture.

Hathora Builder's abstractions greatly simplify these aspects so that you can focus on what matters - making your game!

- Declarative [API format](type-driven-development.md) with code generation of typesafe data models and clients

- Built in [matchmaking](state.md?id=lifecycle) service
