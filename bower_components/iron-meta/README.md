## &lt;iron-meta&gt;

`iron-meta` is a generic element you can use for sharing information across the DOM tree.
It uses [monostate pattern](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MonostatePattern) such that any
instance of iron-meta has access to the shared
information. You can use `iron-meta` to share whatever you want (or create an extension
[like x-meta] for enhancements).
